# Computing and Numerics - Week 5 videos

- The file `week_05_lecture.ipynb` contains the notebook used for the slides in both videos.
- The file `int_plots.py` contains the code used to create the plots and estimate the integral in the second video. It's adapted from the code you already have in your tutorial sheet.
